Program flow - signature:
1) Gather multiple versions of the same signatures, along with the full name of the person they belong to
2) Just like with printed and handwritten, train a recognision system with multiple versions of these signatures, but this time making sure the output nodes correspond to the total number of people in the dataset
3) Tweak the neural network as necessary

Program flow - written notes:
1) Gather some notes of a person along with their full name
2) Use some kind of feature extraction to find similarities in the notes
3) Train a recognision system on these notes, then test how the recognision system performs with new notes
4) Report findings
